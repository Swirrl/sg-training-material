# get the population data from the csv file that we saved before and put into a variable
# if this path doesn't work - browse to the file using the Files panel, then click
# import dataset and get the path from there
# notice the column headers in the dataframe - columns can't begin with numbers, so the X gets added
# in this case, we'll remove them leter on, but we could change the column names

population <- read.csv("data/exercise_1_data.csv",stringsAsFactors = F)

# ggplot prefers data in a tidy format - one observation per row
# the gather function makes data tidy

population_tidy <- population %>%
                    gather("year","value",3:9)

# get the single year from the year column of the dataframe (using substr(ing) function)

population_tidy$year <- substr(population_tidy$year,2,6)

# now we filter the dataframe to only scotland. There are different ways to do this 
# - subset, filter by row reference, and dplyr. We'll look at 'which' first, then dplyr later on

population_tidy_scotland <- population_tidy[which(population_tidy$Reference.Area == 'Scotland'),]

# now we draw a chart using ggplot - raw, ggplot defaults
